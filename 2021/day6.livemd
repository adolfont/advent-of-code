# Advent of Code 2021 - Day 6

## Setup

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:kino, "~> 0.4.1"}
])
```

## Test Input

```elixir
test_input = """
3,4,3,1,2
"""
```

```elixir
test_input =
  test_input
  |> String.split([",", "\n"], trim: true)
  |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)
```

## Puzzle Input

```elixir
puzzle_input = Kino.Input.textarea("Please paste your Day 6 puzzle input:")
```

```elixir
puzzle_input =
  puzzle_input
  |> Kino.Input.read()
  |> String.split([",", "\n"], trim: true)
  |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)
```

## Part 1 - Naive recursion

```elixir
defmodule NaiveRecursion do
  def recur(school, day, days_to_model) when day == days_to_model, do: school

  def recur(school, day, days_to_model) do
    school
    |> Enum.reduce([], fn fish, new ->
      next = fish - 1

      case next do
        -1 ->
          [6 | [8 | new]]

        _ ->
          [next | new]
      end
    end)
    |> recur(day + 1, days_to_model)
  end
end
```

```elixir
NaiveRecursion.recur(test_input, 0, 18) |> Enum.count()
```

```elixir
NaiveRecursion.recur(test_input, 0, 80) |> Enum.count()
```

## Part 1 with puzzle input

```elixir
NaiveRecursion.recur(puzzle_input, 0, 80) |> Enum.count()
```

## Part 2 - Cycling the fish counts between days

We don't need to do the work of actually making the lists as describe by the puzzle
prompt, that's a red herring! We can cycle the fish counts between days. The trick
is that zero counts will cycle to both 8 and 6.Ï

We model that by using a tuple and recursion. Every recurrance we shift the ages
down by one day. When rotating from zero we add that number to both the counts of
fish that are eight days old **and** the counts of fish that are six days old.

Using the naive recursion for 256 days of calculations means computational explosions!

```elixir
defmodule TupleRecursion do
  def recur(school, day, days_to_model) when is_list(school) do
    school_counts = Enum.frequencies(school)

    0..8
    |> Enum.reduce({}, fn age, counts ->
      Tuple.append(counts, Map.get(school_counts, age, 0))
    end)
    |> recur(day + 1, days_to_model)
  end

  def recur(age_counts, day, days_to_model) when day > days_to_model, do: age_counts

  def recur({age0, age1, age2, age3, age4, age5, age6, age7, age8}, day, days_to_model) do
    {age1, age2, age3, age4, age5, age6, age7 + age0, age8, age0}
    |> recur(day + 1, days_to_model)
  end
end
```

## Part 2 with test input

<!-- livebook:{"reevaluate_automatically":true} -->

```elixir
TupleRecursion.recur(test_input, 0, 18) |> Tuple.sum()
```

```elixir
TupleRecursion.recur(test_input, 0, 80) |> Tuple.sum()
```

## Part 2 with puzzle input

```elixir
TupleRecursion.recur(puzzle_input, 0, 256) |> Tuple.sum()
```
